        <h2>By President Russell M. Nelson</h2>
        <p><strong>Make your focus on daily repentance so integral to your life that you can exercise the priesthood with greater power than ever before.</strong></p>
        <p> My dear brethren, it is inspiring to look out over this vast congregation of the Lord’s battalion of priesthood bearers. What a mighty force for good you are! We love you. We pray for you. And we are most grateful for you.</p>
        <p> Recently I have found myself drawn to the Lord’s instruction given through the Prophet Joseph Smith: <mark>“Say nothing but repentance unto this generation.” </mark>This declaration is often repeated throughout scripture. It prompts an obvious question: “Does everyone need to repent?” The answer is yes.</p>
        <p> Too many people consider repentance as punishment—something to be avoided except in the most serious circumstances. But this feeling of being penalized is engendered by Satan. He tries to block us from looking to Jesus Christ, who stands with open arms, hoping and willing to heal, forgive, cleanse, strengthen, purify, and sanctify us.</p>
        <p> The word for <em>repentance</em> in the Greek New Testament is <em>metanoeo</em>. The prefix <em>meta-</em> means “change.” The suffix <em>-noeo</em> is related to Greek words that mean “mind,” “knowledge,” “spirit,” and “breath.” <sup>1</sup></p>
        <p> Thus, when Jesus asks you and me to “repent,” He is inviting us to change our mind, our knowledge, our spirit—even the way we breathe. He is asking us to change the way we love, think, serve, spend our time, treat our wives, teach our children, and even care for our bodies.</p>
        <p id="targetParagraph"> <b>Nothing is more liberating, more ennobling, or more crucial to our individual progression than is a regular, daily focus on repentance.</b> Repentance is not an event; it is a process. It is the key to happiness and peace of mind. When coupled with faith, repentance opens our access to the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<sup>2</sup></p>
