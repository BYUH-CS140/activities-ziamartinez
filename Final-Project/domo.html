                Domo’s business management platform is designed to turn disparate data into actionable insights,
                providing the context necessary for faster, better-informed decisions. While traditional reporting often
                leads to backlogs, Domo automates these processes by connecting to your data in real time, empowering
                dynamic business intelligence. Explore how I've leveraged Domo to create powerful, automated reporting
                solutions.

                <h3 class="project-title">BYU–Hawaii: Graduation Rate Performance Analysis</h3>
                <p class="project-description">
                    <strong>Challenge:</strong> BYU–Hawaii needed a clear and consistent way to compare its graduation
                    performance against regional and national peer institutions, track completion rates from 4-year to
                    8-year, and monitor longitudinal data trends alongside undergraduate headcount.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    <strong>My Role & Solution:</strong> I developed an interactive Domo dashboard focused on
                    institutional graduation performance. This involved:
                <ul>
                    <li>Integrating various data sources including student records and institutional benchmarks.</li>
                    <li>Building calculated metrics to track 4-year, 6-year, and 8-year graduation rates.</li>
                    <li>Designing comparative visualizations to benchmark BYU–Hawaii against other institutions.</li>
                    <li>Implementing trend lines and historical data views for long-term strategic planning.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> The dashboard provided university leadership and academic departments with
                    critical insights into student success, enabling them to identify areas for improvement in student
                    retention and program efficacy, ultimately supporting strategic initiatives to enhance graduation
                    rates.

                <p class="project-description">
                    <strong>Challenge:</strong> The university required a comprehensive snapshot of key academic success
                    indicators, including student headcount, graduation and retention rates, financial aid distribution,
                    and demographic trends (specifically by ethnicity) over a multi-year period (2017 to 2022).
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    <strong>My Role & Solution:</strong> I designed and implemented a dynamic Domo dashboard summarizing
                    critical student academic success data. My process included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Connecting to and transforming diverse student data sets for unified analysis.</li>
                    <li>Creating detailed visualizations for demographic breakdowns, including ethnic groups.</li>
                    <li>Developing interactive charts to track financial aid distribution and its correlation with
                        retention.</li>
                    <li>Ensuring data refreshes were automated for real-time insights into student progress.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="project-description">
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> This dashboard provided academic advisors, institutional research, and
                    administration with a powerful tool to monitor student demographics and performance, informing
                    targeted support programs, resource allocation, and initiatives aimed at improving student outcomes
                    and equity across different groups.
