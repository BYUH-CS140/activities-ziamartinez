                    I had the chance to work with Zia in a group project using Domo, and she was a key part of our success. She often took the lead in meetings, helping us stay on track and making sure everyone was heard. Zia was always supportive, ready to help with any issues, and focused on finding the best solutions together. Her teamwork, leadership, and positive attitude made a big difference. I learned a lot from working with her and would be happy to team up again in the future.
