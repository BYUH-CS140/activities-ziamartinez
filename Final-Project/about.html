        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          Growing up in the Philippines, I saw firsthand how small businesses and communities struggled to make sense of the numbers that surrounded them—sales reports, government statistics, market trends. My curiosity for technology started with helping my family run their small enterprise, using simple spreadsheets to track and make better decisions. What began as a necessity turned into a passion.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I moved to Hawaii to pursue my degree at BYU–Hawaii, I carried with me a mission: to use data not just as numbers, but as a language for change. I’ve since discovered how powerful analytics can be—when used ethically and creatively—to solve real problems, tell compelling stories, and bridge understanding between people and systems.
