                <div class="about-intro-text"> <h2>My Data Journey: From Spreadsheets to Strategic Insights</h2>
                    <p>
                        My fascination with data began not in a classroom, but in the bustling markets of the Philippines, where I witnessed firsthand the challenges small businesses faced in navigating economic fluctuations and market trends. I saw the power hidden in everyday numbers – sales figures, inventory counts, local statistics – and how understanding them could truly transform operations. My early experience, supporting my family's real estate business with simple spreadsheets to track performance and inform decisions, ignited a lifelong passion for transforming raw data into actionable intelligence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moving to Hawaii and pursuing my degree at BYU–Hawaii deepened this commitment. Here, I immersed myself in the technical foundations of data science, honing skills in <strong>SQL, Python, R, and advanced analytics tools like Domo, Power BI, and Tableau</strong>. My academic journey, enriched by projects in areas like <strong>predictive modeling and data visualization</strong>, allowed me to see data not merely as information, but as a universal language for understanding and driving change. I learned to extract meaningful narratives from complex datasets, ensuring insights are not only accurate but also ethically sound and impactful.
