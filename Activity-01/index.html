    <h3> If you were a boat, what type would you be? </h3>
    <p> If I were a boat, I would be a cruiser because it is a type of warship. I believe that every day, we face battles and if we are </p>
    <p> on Jesus' side, we will always win. I chose cruiser because I'm a fighter and I don't easily give up.</p>
